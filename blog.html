      <h3><b>What is ethereum?</b></h3>
      <h5>In a nutshell: Ethereum is a powerful, decentralised, super computer running on blockchain technology. Some key innovations make Ethereum a unique project with all the necessary building blocks to create a new, better, more secure, privacy and trust oriented internet. And that’s a big deal <span class="w3-opacity">May 28, 2020</span></h5>

      <p>Ethereum aims to be a platform on which anyone can create applications for value and data exchange. Its technology is based on “smart contracts”, programs that run on Ethereum and execute transactions of value and information.Ethereum is an open source, public, blockchain-based distributed computing platform and operating system featuring smart contract functionality. It supports a modified version of Nakamoto consensus via transaction-based state transitions.The structure of the ethereum blockchain is very similar to bitcoin’s, in that it is a shared record of the entire transaction history. Every node on the network stores a copy of this history.

The big difference with ethereum is that its nodes store the most recent state of each smart contract, in addition to all of the ether transactions. (This is much more complicated than described, but the text below should help you get your feet wet.)</p>

      <h3><b>How blockchain works?</b></h3>
      <h5> It is imperative to learn Blockchain technology, how it works, and how it’s becoming vital in the digital world.<span class="w3-opacity">May 28, 2020</span></h5>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>In recent years, you may have noticed many businesses around the world integrating Blockchain technology. But how exactly does Blockchain technology work? Is this a significant change or a simple addition? The advancements of Blockchain are still young and have the potential to be revolutionary in the future; so, let’s begin demystifying this technology.

Blockchain is a combination of three leading technologies:

Cryptographic keys
A peer-to-peer network containing a shared ledger
A means of computing, to store the transactions and records of the network
Cryptography keys consist of two keys – Private key and Public key. These keys help in performing successful transactions between two parties. Each individual has these two keys, which they use to produce a secure digital identity reference. This secured identity is the most important aspect of Blockchain technology. In the world of cryptocurrency, this identity is referred to as ‘digital signature’ and is used for authorizing and controlling transactions.

The digital signature is merged with the peer-to-peer network; a large number of individuals who act as authorities use the digital signature in order to reach a consensus on transactions, among other issues. When they authorize a deal, it is certified by a mathematical verification, which results in a successful secured transaction between the two network-connected parties. So to sum it up, Blockchain users employ cryptography keys to perform different types of digital interactions over the peer-to-peer network.</p>
